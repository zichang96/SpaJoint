# SpaJoint
SpaJoint: a transfer learning method for spatial transcriptomics deconvolution.\
SpaJoint is a transfer learning method that integrates gene expression derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics with the spatial correlation across different tissue locations.

# Tutorials
A step-by-step tutorial using scRNA-seq and ST hippocampus data ([link](https://github.com/zichang96/SpaJoint/tree/main/example)) which were generated by selecting highly variable genes and randomly sampling 500 cells and spots respectively from the original data is demonstrated here: [link](https://github.com/zichang96/SpaJoint/blob/main/tutorial.py)
